            <p>We completed a competitive audit to check out what other recipe apps on the market offered and to find out what they were missing. With so many websites, cookbooks and other resources online, it can be time-consuming and tedious to find a healthy recipe that fits each personâ€™s dietary restrictions and taste preferences. <br /> <br /> 
            Many apps on the market are based on sharing their own recipes, however, these platforms lack community, variety and the ability to share recipes with others. <br /> <br />
            We found that three major things: <br /> <br />
            1. Not all platforms had unique and interesting recipes <br />
            2. Existing platforms do not focus on the healthiness of the recipe <br />
            3. Platforms do not allow users to add their own recipes`</p>,
